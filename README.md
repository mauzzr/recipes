# Recipes repository

This is a dumping ground for literal culinary recipes. I decided to store them on GitHub in my dotfiles repo a while ago when I realized that GitHub is pretty much the ideal solution for hosting them as markdown source. However, since the dotfiles repo is private and I occasionally have cause to share the recipes or view them from a device that's not logged into my GitHub account, I split them off into this one.
