# Artisan Bread

## Meta
* Yield: 2 loaves
* Total time w/ rise: ~3h
* Adapted from a [King Arthur Flour](https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/the-easiest-loaf-of-bread-youll-ever-bake-recipe) recipe

## Ingredients
* 600g bread flour
* 380g water, lukewarm (~100 F/38 C)
* 7g active dry yeast
* 15g salt
* Corn meal (optional; for dusting the pan)

## Method
1. *Optional*: Bloom dry yeast to verify that it is active
1. Combine flour, yeast, salt, and water in a large mixing bowl. Mix until a shaggy dough forms
1. Turn dough out onto a floured work surface; knead until smooth and gluten is developed (~7-8 minutes)
    * *Note*: We're looking for a supple dough that springs back when an impression is made with a finger
    * The "window pane" test also works well for small batches like this
    * *Alternatively*, use the dough hook attachment of a stand mixer for 7 minutes
1. Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl (any cooking oil is fine) and let rise 1-2 hours\
    or until doubled in size
1. Punch back the dough and form into two loaves
1. Line a sheet pan with parchment paper and dust with corn meal or flour;\
    put the loaves on the sheet and let proof another 45 minutes
    * **CAUTION**: The parchment must be able to withstand the baking temperature (see below).\
        If you don't have parchment that can withstand that temp, use a bare sheet pan instead\
        and dust generously with corn meal or flour. If you're lucky enough to have a Silpat,\
        it works just as well for this as for everything else.
        * *If you're curious, when you bake parchment paper above its rated temperature it will*\
            *char and impart some acrid burnt flavors to whatever you're baking. No bueno.*
1. Toward the end of the proof, preheat oven to 450 F / 230 C with a heavy, oven-safe pan on the lowest rack.\
    Boil some water.
    * *Note*: A cast iron skillet or a roasting pan would work well here.
    * *Alternatively*, if you have a dutch oven you may forego the sheet pan and the extra pan\
        and bake the bread in the dutch oven instead. The dutch oven gets the same flour/corn meal\
        treatment describe above.
1. When this second proof is done, dust each loaf lightly with flour and score
    * 2-3 diagonal scores is a good place to start; feel free to experiment and use your imagination
1. Wearing oven mitts for protection against steam, put the bread in the oven, then add boiling water to the\
    pan on the lower rack. Close the oven door quickly to trap the steam inside.
1. Bake 20-30 minutes; the bread is fully baked when it makes a hollow sound when you tap on the bottom of the loaf
1. Turn off the oven, crack the oven door open and leave the bread inside for 5 minutes\
    (*this supposedly helps keep the crust crisp; I haven't done any testing here though*)
1. Remove the bread to a wire rack to cool completely before slicing.
    * *Or at least as cool as possible... warm bread is the good shit*
1. Store the bread well-wrapped for a few days or freeze for long-term storage.
