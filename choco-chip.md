## Meta
* Yield: 24 normal sized cookies or 12 large cookies
  Time w/ rest: 45 minutes to overnight
* Adapted from [a recipe by the venerable Alvin Zhou](https://tasty.co/recipe/the-best-chewy-chocolate-chip-cookies)

## Ingredients
* 90g granulated sugar
* 150g brown sugar
* 7g salt
* 115g unsalted butter, browned
* 30mL-ish almond or oat milk (just eyeball it you'll see)
* 1 egg
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 180g all-purpose flour
* 3g baking soda
* 115g each semisweet and dark chocolate chunks

## Method
1. Brown the butter.
2. Whisk together sugars, butter and salt until combined, then stream in just enough milk to make a smooth paste.
3. Add egg and vanilla, beating until ribbons fall from the whisk and remain briefly before sinking into the mixture.
4. Sift in the flour and baking soda, then fold with a spatula until combined. Do not overmix.
5. Fold in the chocolate chunks.
6. Chill the dough at least 30 minutes, up to overnight.
7. Preheat oven to 350F/180C.
8. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
9. Pick an ice cream scoop or spoon that looks about the right size and portion the dough into evenly sized and spaced balls on the prepared sheet
10. Bake 12-15 minutes (perhaps a bit less if the cookies are small)
