# Sandwich Bread

## Meta
* Yield: 1 loaf
* Total time w/ rise: ~2 hours

## Ingredients
* 500g bread flour
* 300g water, lukewarm (~100 F/38 C)
* 3.5g yeast
* 10g salt
* 30ml cooking oil of choice

## Method
1. *Optional*: Bloom dry yeast to verify that it is active
1. Combine all ingredients in a large mixing bowl. Mix until a shaggy dough forms
1. Turn dough out onto a floured work surface; knead until smooth and gluten is developed (~8-10 minutes)
    * *Note*: We're looking for a supple dough that springs back when an impression is made with a finger
    * The "window pane" test also works well for small batches like this
    * *Alternatively*, use the dough hook attachment of a stand mixer for 8 minutes
1. Return the dough to a lightly greased bowl and let rise 1 hour
1. Knock back the dough and shape it into a loaf
1. Generously dust a loaf pan with flour and place the dough in the pan
1. Let the loaf proof in the pan for 45 minutes
1. Toward the end of the proof, preheat oven to 450 F / 230 C with a heavy, oven-safe pan on the lowest rack.
    * *Note*: A cast iron skillet or a roasting pan would work well here.
1. Wearing oven mitts for protection against steam, put the bread in the oven, then add boiling water to the\
    pan on the lower rack. Close the oven door quickly to trap the steam inside.
1. Bake 30-35 minutes.
1. Remove the bread to a wire rack to cool completely before slicing.
    * *Or at least as cool as possible... warm bread is the good shit*
1. Store the bread well-wrapped for a few days or freeze for long-term storage.
